# [Todo App with minimal code](https://j-boardman.github.io/todo-min-code/)

Bare bones todo app made for fun to see how little code I could get away with writing. Resulted in > 150 lines between HTML, CSS and JS. Includes basic CRUD capabilities to the localstorage browser API. Just need to fix some date parsing!
