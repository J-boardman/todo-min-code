# [Todo App with minimal code](https://j-boardman.github.io/todo-min-code/)

Bare bones todo app made for fun to see how little code I could get away with writing. Resulted in less than 150 lines between HTML, CSS and JS (3.7kb app). Includes basic CRUD capabilities to the localstorage browser API. Just need to fix some date parsing!
